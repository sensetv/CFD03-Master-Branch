#CFD03 Project - Hyperledger Bazaar (HLB)
-----
Hyper Ledger Bazaar (HLB) is a network designed as a global marketplace for merchants to trade and transact with organizations. The network focus is primarily to create a central hub for global trade. With increase adoption, ranging from raw materials to finished goods, the network can be leveraged as a economic analyses tool gaining real time insight into demand, supply and price elasticity of the materials or good.

For proof of concept and demonstrative purposes, the current state of HLB is limited to minimum Client and Peer nodes with one Organization able to view and transact with merchants selling Fruit. In this example, each merchant is limited to selling one type of fruit. However, the market is subject to constant changes in demand, and the prices of the fruit will increase as the demand grows!

##Chaincode Overview
-----
Smart Contracts within the Hyperledger Bazaar network are designed to record transactions between Merchants and Organizations.

The chaincode parameters include;

Participant - ```Merchant Name`` | ```Organization Name```

Asset - ```Product```

Transaction - | ```Amount (Volume)``` | ```Price```


##Future Plans and Timeline Overview
-----
Ambitiously, Hyperledger Bazaar aims to be the central hub for global trade. This means working with multinational corporations and as well as government organizations. Working close together in order to understand their needs and adapt the Network to drive onboarding and adoption of the platform.

As the network grows and adapts to the complexities of all industries the aim is have a network that is flexible and for that the chaincode and database capabilities are not limited to what is currently available. As the capabilities of the network grow, it will no longer be necessary to manage the changes by a central authority, and peers will be allowed to interact with each other directly. Such permissions will be given to the merchants upon entering the network. 

Every day that goes by, there is change and there are those that can adapt and those that fall behind. By creating a trust-based system of open communication and a publicly available ledger accessible by all, merchants can feel confident conducting trade in the marketplace. Hyperledger Bazaar is the solution for an evolving world ready to adapt and overcome all obstacles the future brings us.
